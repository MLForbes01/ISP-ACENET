Forecasting Family Physician Availability: Trends and Dynamics in New Brunswick :	

This project provides an in-depth analysis of 52 years of supply and distribution data for physicians in Canada, focusing on family doctors in New Brunswick. Through comprehensive descriptive statistical analysis, it highlights historical trends and develops a prediction model to forecast the number of family physicians beyond 2022, offering valuable insights for addressing physician shortages in the province.	

The dataset used in this research contains 52 years (from 1971 to 2022) of data about physician supply and distribution in Canada, including demographic, education, and migration information. I am particularly interested in the columns for Specialty, Physician-to-100,000 population ratio, Number of physicians, Number male, Number female, Average age, Number in urban areas, and Number in rural areas.
